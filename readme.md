JDON FRAMEWORK
===================================

JdonFramework is a java Reactive/Actor framework that you can use to build your Domain Driven Design + CQRS + EventSourcing  applications with asynchronous concurrency and higher throughput.

JdonFramework = DDD + Event Sourcing + CQRS + asynchronous + concurrency + higher throughput.

JdonFramework = Ioc/DI/AOP + reactive Actors model

Why Reactive?
===================================

Reactive Programming is a hot topic , especially with such things as the [Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/).
Reactive architecture allows developers to build systems that are event-driven(EDA), scalable, resilient and responsive: delivering highly responsive user experiences with a real-time feel, backed by a scalable and resilient application stack, ready to be deployed on multicore and cloud computing architectures.
a reactive application is non-blocking that is under heavy load can thus have lower latency and higher throughput than a traditional application based on blocking synchronization and communication primitives.

Why DDD?
===================================
Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to developing software for complex needs by deeply connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts,

DDD's servral concepts are the Heart and Soul of OOD:

```python
Entities and Identity, Value Objects
Aggregate Root
Bounded context
```

Why CQRS?
===================================

CQRS: Command-query Responsibility Segregation, at its heart is a simple notion that you can use a different model to update information than the model you use to read information.

Why Jdon?
===================================

Jdon introduces reactive and event-driven into domain, using jdon, a aggregate root can act as a mailbox(like scala's Actors) that is a asynchronous and non-blocking event-sending and event-recipient metaphor.
Event is a better interactive way for aggregate root with each other, instead of directly exposing behavior and hold references to others.
and it can better protect root entity's internal state not expose. and can safely update root's state in non-blocking way [Single Writer Principle](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2012/08/single-writer-principle.html).

Jdon moves mutable state from database to memory, and uses Aggregate Root to guard it, traditional database's data operations (by SQL or JPA/ORM) not need any more, only need send a Command or Event to drive Aggregate Root to change its mutable state by its behaviours

```java
@Model
public class AggregateRootA {

	private int state = 100;

	@OnCommand("CommandtoEventA")
	public Object save(ParameterVO parameterVO) {

		//update root's state in non-blocking single thread way (Single Writer)
		this.state = parameterVO.getValue() + state;

	}

}
```

Jdonframework work mode is Producer/Consumer, A producer emits to its Consumer by a asynchronous and non-blocking queue made by LMAX Disruptor's RingBuffer.
such as:

@Send("CommandtoEventA") ---> @OnCommand("CommandtoEventA")

There are two kinds of Consumer in jdon:

```java
@Send --> @OnCommand  (1:1 Queue)
@Send --> @OnEvent    (1:N topic)
```

Difference between 'OnCommand' and 'OnEvent' is:

When a event happend otherwhere comes in a aggregate root we regard this event
as a command, and it will action a method annotated with @OnCommand,
and in this method some events will happen. and they will action those methods annotated with @OnEvent.

Actor Model
===================================

Jdon can make your Domain Model as Actor(erlang/akka) concurrent model, no any lock. this is a transaction example about transferring money from one bank account to another:

```java
@Model
public class BankAccount {

	....

	@OnCommand("depositCommand")
	public Object deposit(TransferEvent transferEvent) {
		int amount2 = amount + transferEvent.getValue();
		if (amount2 > 1000) {
			TransferEvent transferEventNew = new ResultEvent(
					transferEvent.getId(), transferEvent.getValue(),
					this.getId());
			return domainEventProducer.failure(transferEventNew);
		}

		if (!(transferEvent instanceof WithdrawEvent)) {// first step
			DepositEvent transferEventNew = new DepositEvent(
					transferEvent.getId(), transferEvent.getValue(),
					transferEvent.getNextId(), this.getId());
			eventsourcesD.put(transferEventNew.getId(), transferEventNew);
			return domainEventProducer.nextStep(transferEventNew);
		}

		WithdrawEvent de = (WithdrawEvent) transferEvent;
		amount = amount + transferEvent.getValue();
		TransferEvent transferEventNew = new ResultEvent(transferEvent.getId(),
				transferEvent.getValue(), de.getPreId());
		return domainEventProducer.finish(transferEventNew);

	}

	@OnCommand("withdrawCommand")
	public Object withdraw(TransferEvent transferEvent) {
		int amount2 = amount - transferEvent.getValue();
		if (amount2 < 0) {
			String rootId = (transferEvent instanceof DepositEvent) ? ((DepositEvent) transferEvent)
					.getPreId() : this.getId();
			TransferEvent transferEventNew = new ResultEvent(
					transferEvent.getId(), transferEvent.getValue(), rootId);
			return domainEventProducer.failure(transferEventNew);
		}

		if (!(transferEvent instanceof DepositEvent)) {// first step
			WithdrawEvent transferEventNew = new WithdrawEvent(
					transferEvent.getId(), transferEvent.getValue(),
					transferEvent.getNextId(), this.getId());
			eventsourcesW.put(transferEventNew.getId(), transferEventNew);
			return domainEventProducer.nextStep(transferEventNew);

		}

		DepositEvent de = (DepositEvent) transferEvent;
		amount = amount - transferEvent.getValue();
		TransferEvent transferEventNew = new ResultEvent(transferEvent.getId(),
				transferEvent.getValue(), de.getPreId());
		return domainEventProducer.finish(transferEventNew);

	}

	@OnCommand("finishCommand")
	public Object finish(TransferEvent transferEvent) {
		if (eventsourcesW.containsKey(transferEvent.getId())){
			eventsourcesW.remove(transferEvent.getId());
			amount = amount - transferEvent.getValue();
		}else if (eventsourcesD.containsKey(transferEvent.getId())){
			eventsourcesD.remove(transferEvent.getId());
			amount = amount + transferEvent.getValue();
		}
		return transferEvent;
	}

	@OnCommand("failureCommand")
	public Object fail(TransferEvent transferEvent) {
		eventsourcesD.remove(transferEvent.getId());
		return transferEvent;
	}

	....

}
```

transfer money client code:

```java
AppUtil appUtil = new AppUtil();
AccountService accountService = (AccountService) appUtil
		.getComponentInstance("accountService");
BankAccount bankAccountA = accountService.getBankAccount("11", 100);
BankAccount bankAccountB = accountService.getBankAccount("22", 0);
DomainMessage res = accountService.transfer(bankAccountA, bankAccountB,
		100);

DomainMessage res1 = (DomainMessage) res.getBlockEventResult();
DomainMessage result = (DomainMessage) res1.getBlockEventResult();
Object o = result.getBlockEventResult();// block until all transfer ok;

Assert.assertEquals(0, bankAccountA.getAmount());
Assert.assertEquals(100, bankAccountB.getAmount());
```
