                    <p>Jdon Framework  is a light-weight framework for developing DDD applications.</p>
                    <p>Jdon Framework = Domain Model + In-memory + Domain Events. </p>
                    <p>  Events implementation of Jdon Framework 6.4 is the Disruptor that it is a concurrent framework can handle 6 million orders per second on a single thread in <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html">LMAX  </a>recommended by Martin Fowler.</p>
                    <p>more details : <STRONG><a href="http://jivejdon.blogspot.com/2011/09/jdon-framework-64-released.html">Jdon Framework_6.4 (Disruptor) </a>released!</STRONG></p>
                <p>Before  Domain-Driven Design(DDD) appears , business logic was implemented by the technical component directly, such as  service,action and so on, and the model objects were all anaemia model , they are just a data collections, on this way, technical  components drive the anaemia models to complete the business logics. this way called &quot;Transaction script&quot;.</p>
                    <p>                      In DDD there is a big different from the traditional script. Domain models drive the technical components to finish the business logics, domain model is like DNA. </p>
                    <p>So our architecture can focus on  business domain model that is easy  to understand ,extend and maintain, in the mean time, domain model also makes  our software systems more scalable,and be better performance.</p>
                    <h2>DDD-Oriented Architecture</h2>
                    <p>for easy focus on the  business domain,Jdon Framework make domain model easy to living in a software system.</p>
                    <h2> In Memory Domain model </h2>
                    <p> domain model  mainly includes the Entity,Value  Object and Service that all focus on the  business domain,it is nothing to do with the concrete technical  implementation. but we need let them living in the technical  system.</p>
                    <p>In Jdon Framework, these domain models are marked with the @Model  annotation, so they are in memory and     send asynchronous events or message to the consumers .</p>
                    <p><img src="images/domainevents.png" width="606" height="349" alt="de"></p>
                    <p><br>
                      domain model is the core of our  software systems,their lifecycles management is very important, Jdon Framework makes  the management of domain model's lifecycles more easily, domain model lives  in the in-memory cache ,such as ehcache,oscache,terracotta ....,so the software  system will be more scalable with the distributed cache system ,such as  terracotta ,memcached.</p>
                    <p><br>
                      However,cache is a very low-level  technical layer,if we allow the developers to manually interact with  cache,then it will easily lead to errors and inconsistecies,so Jdon Framework  integrates two interceptors ,one is &quot;CacheInterceptor&quot; ,the other is &quot;DomainCacheInterceptor&quot;,they  both are configured in the &quot;aspect.xml&quot; file which is a config file  of Jdon Framework.</p>
                    <p><br>
                      First let's see  &quot;CacheInterceptor&quot;:</p>
                  <p>&quot;CacheIntercep&quot;  is between the presentation layer and  business layer,when the presentation action invoke the &quot;get*()&quot; method  of business service,the CacheInterceptor will intercept the invocation,it first  checks  that whether the domain model  object already is the cache,if the model object is not in  cache,CacheInterceptor will invoke the next interceptor which is in the interceptor  chain,and finally the model object will be fetched from persistence  datasource,the CacheInterceptor will gain the fetched model object and put it  into the cache.</p>
                    <p><br>
                      I guess you have understood how the  CacheInterceptor works,now i will introduce you how the DomainCacheInteceptor  works?</p>
                    <p>DomainCacheInterceptor is between business layer(domain model live in this layer) and the persistence  layer,before the business layer invoking the persistence layer component to  fetch the model, the DomainCacheInterceptor will intercept the invocation,it  will also check that whether the model has already in the cache,if  in,DomainCacheInterceptor just return the cached Model,or else  it will put the model which is retrieved from  persistence datasource into the cache.</p>
                    <p><br>
                      Last let me see the followed diagram,the  diagram describes the relation of the two interceptors. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><img src="images/6.2.model.cache.arch.png" alt="aa" width="651" height="364"> </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2>The architecture components</h2>
                    <p>There are five components model in Jdon Framework, they are:</p>
                    <div>
                      <div>1. Entity Model with @Model;&#13;</div>
                      <div>2. Service with @Service;&#13;technical component</div>
                      <div>3. Component with @Component ;&#13;technical component</div>
                      <div>4. Prodcuer-Consumer mode with @send @Consumer;&#13;</div>
                      <div>5. Interceptor with @ Interceptor, need with @Introduce;&#13;</div>
                      <div>  All  in com.jdon.annotation.*&#13;</div>
                      <div></div>
                    </div>
<p>As mentioned above,Jdon Framework seperates the  application architecture into two parts:Domain models and technical components  .</p>
<p>domain models lives in the cache ,and the technical components lives in  the IOC container.</p>
<p>  The technical component's lifecycles  management is also important,Jdon Framework use the IOC container to manage the  lifecycles of technical components,at the same time,the IOC container is also  holded in the context container such as the ServeltContext.</p>
<p>Jdon Framework uses the interceptors to inject the technical  components into the domain models.</p>
<p>By the Jdon Framework,it will drive you to  develop your application with the OO style,what's more,in this style,The domain  models drive the components to finish the business operations,so do you smell  the flavor of DDD ?</p>
<h2>Domain Events and CQRS or EDA</h2>
                    <p>As the DDD framework,it is essential  to solve the interaction between the domain  model and the technical component,Jdon Framework apply the domain event pattern  to make the domain models less coupling with technical components.the core architecture  diagram as the followed here:</p>
                    <p><img src="images/CQRS.png" width="387" height="330"></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>As the above diagram description,when  domain models trigger some domain events,the domain event will generate proper  domain message,at last the messageListener will treat with the event,and assist  with the business logic.</p>
                    <p>Domain Event is a Producer-Consumer or Publisher-Subscriber patterns; Asynchronous; topic or queue (1:N or 1:1) ; Domain Model is a producer; it send events or message to the consumers:</p>
                    <p>@Send(topicName) =&gt; @Consumer(topicName);</p>
                    <p>the Topic mode is powered by <a href="code.google.com/p/disruptor/">disruptor</a>. that is fast concurrent programming framework that introduced by Martin fowler :<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html" target="_parent" onClick="window.event.cancelBubble=true;">LMAX Architecture</a>.</p>
                    <p>if there are many consumers, their started order is by its class name's alphabetical . such AEventHandler is first be reaction; and then BEventHandler and CEve.......<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><br>
                      If you want to use Domain event ,you  just need to use three Annotations,@Introduce,@Inject and @Send.for example,we  have a model class named MyModel,and a domain event named MyDomainEvent ,the  code is as here:</p>
                    <table width="90%" border="0" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
                      <tr>

                               } </p>
                          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>public</strong> String getName() { <br>
                            <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if</strong> (<strong>this</strong>.name == <strong>null</strong>) { </p>

                          }</p>
                          <p>@Introduce(&quot;message&quot;) <br>
                              <strong>public</strong> <strong>class</strong> MyModelDomainEvent { </p>
                          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@Send(value=&quot;MyModel.findName&quot;,asyn=<strong>true</strong>) <br>
                            <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public</strong> DomainMessage asyncFindName(MyModel  myModel) { <br>

                      </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p>When you retrieve MyModel from service  or repository,the CacheInterceptor and the DomainCacheInterceptor will inject  the MyModelDomainEvent and MyModelService into MyModel,when injecting the  MyModelDomainEvent,@Introduce(&quot;message&quot;) will  lead MyModelDomainEvent to be enhanced with  MessageInterceptor,when myModel.getName() is invoked, the MessageListenner will  intercept the invocation,it will choose proper means to drive the  MessageListner to response this event request.</p>
                    <h3> domain event programming steps:</h3>
                    <p>1. keep domain model in-memory cache:</p>
                    <div>
                      <div>@Model&#13;</div>
                      <div>public class User {&#13;</div>
                      <div>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private String userId;&#13;</div>
                      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private String name;&#13;</div>
                      <div>     ....&#13;</div>
                      <div>}&#13;</div>
                      <div>A class with @Model will live in memory, default is Cache (Ehcache). Or Key-value store others.&#13;</div>
                      <div></div>
                    </div>
<p>When a domain model object with @Model is fetch from repository, we need use @Introduce(“modelCache”) to mak the object live in memory.<br>
</p>
<p>@Introduce(“modelCache”) must be annotated in 
  the interfaces that @Model objects are created or reconstructed  
  , the interfaces is such as repository class.</p>
<p><strong>This step is very important for domain events working,</strong></p>
                    <p><img src="images/introducecache.png" width="416" height="208" alt="cachge"></p>
                    <p>2.annotate producer class with @Model and @Introduce(&quot;message&quot;)<br>
                    annotate the method with @Send(&quot;mytopic&quot;) of the producer class</p>
                    <p><img src="images/de1.png" width="390" height="230"></p>
                    <p>@Introduce(“message”)：&quot;message&quot;  is the om.jdon.domain.message.MessageInterceptor configured in aspect.xml
                    It means introducing a MessageInterceptor for this class.</p>
                    <p>@ Send(&quot;mytopic&quot;): &quot;mytopic&quot; is your topic name that equals to the &quot;mytopic&quot; in @Consumer(&quot;mytopic&quot;);<br>
                      In this method, you must marshal your data into a DomainMessag that can be unmarshal in consumers.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>3.(1) . annotate consumer class with@Consumer(&quot;mytopic&quot;);<br>
                      (2). the consumer class need implement
com.jdon.domain.message.DomainEventHandler</p>
                    <p><img src="images/de2.png" width="667" height="198"><br>
  </p>
                    <div></div>
<p><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>another domain events sample : </p>
<p><img src="images/domain_events.gif" alt="s" width="502" height="600"></p>
<p>@Send(topic) ==&gt; @Component(topic);<br>
  the consumer  is a class with @Component(topic) that need implement com.jdon.domain.message.MessageListener,
  Consumer is a future or weight or cron task.</p>
<h2>DCI</h2>
<p>DCI: Data, Context, Interactions is a programming paradigm invented by Trygve Reenskaug. the domain model is a Data, the domain events producer is a Role of DCI, it includes the interactions of DCI. </p>
<p>Jdon Framework's domain model injection function can inject the role into the domain model, such as above the class UserDomainEvents is a Role, it can be injected into the model UserModel.so it help UserModel implements business function ComputeCount. In runtime, The Role UserDomainEvents will be injected into the Data UserModel.<br>

  DCI Example:<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jivejdon/downloads/detail?name=SimpleJdonFrameworkTest.rar&amp;can=2&amp;q=">SimpleJdonFrameworkTest.rar</a> </p>
<h2>AOP</h2>
                    <p>Using the  DDD,It is the domain models drive the  technical components to finish the business logics,and in this design style,the  components are just the assistants,which assist the domain models to complete  the business operations.So how the domain models gain the needed  components,Jdon framework use the @Inject and @Component to inject components  and the domain events into models.<br>
                      </p>
                    <p>As the followed diagram illustrates  ,when client invoke the getA(&quot;a&quot;),if Model A with a Introduce,the A  will be enhanced,and the technical component C will also be injected  into the A ,at the same time,when inject the  B,the B will also be enhanced for the @Introduce.</p>

                    <h2>Other Details </h2>
                    <P>Jdon is a RAD tool for writing a
                      small/medium stand-alone JavaEE application. it is a  IOC/AOP
                      framework too, and includes a lightweight Ioc container
                      based on Picocontainer.the feature of Jdon is that all components
                      are replaceable, even includes the framework itself. you
                      can plug in any java objects, Jdon is a embeddable framework. </P>
                    <p>Jdon provides  Domain Driven Development  for data CRUD
                      and batch inquiry (master-details)</p>
                    <p>Jdon is similar with Rubby +  lightweight container,
                      and really simplifies JavaEE development! It can produce
                      high quality
                      applications, faster and at lower cost.</p>
                    <p>By using cache Jdon optimizes the components running performance,
                      such as the dynamic proxy components. Because of the cache optimization, Jdon potentially improves
                      the application system performance, such as batch inquiry
                      operations. The performance of  the JPetstore with Jdon is best among several JPetstores (including iBATIS JPetstore/Spring JPetstore) </p>
                    <p>Jdon seamlessly supports two services: POJO/EJB , it helps
                      you to build a  scalable and extendable small/medium
                      JavaEE system .<br>

                        　　Now There is only one A class in B class code, if there are more other classes such as C/D/E... , when we create B instance, we must spend more energy in creating those instances of A/C/D or E ..</p>
                      <p>　　but, with jdon ioc container, we don't need do these
                        stupid works any more. when we need use any class, we
                        can only fetch it and use it.</p>
                      <p>　　certainly, at first we must configure all these class in jdonframework.xml:</p>

&lt;/app&gt;</p>
                      <p>　　in configure xml, we don't need take care of the relations
                        B with A/C/D, this is important difference from Spring,
                        in Spring configure file, we need add &quot;ref local=a&quot; ,
                        at this point, Jdon is like HiveMind. </p>
                      <h3>Filter and AOP Interceptor</h3>
                      <p>　　Permission and cache can be the Interceptors for the application , here is a sample, in myaspect.xml: </p>
                      <p>&lt;aspect&gt;</p>
                      <p> 　　&lt;interceptor name=&quot;jivejdon_permissionInterceptor&quot; 　　　　　　class=&quot;com.jdon.jivejdon.service.interceptor.PermissionInterceptor&quot;<br>
                        　　　　　　                        pointcut=&quot;pojoServices&quot; /&gt;<br>
                          <br>
                        &lt;/aspect&gt;</p>
                      <p>　　in web.xml we need tell  jdon framework the interceptors configuration:</p>
                      <p>&lt;web-app&gt;<br>
                        　　&lt;context-param&gt;<br>
　　　　&lt;param-name&gt;aspectConfigure&lt;/param-name&gt;<br>
　　　　&lt;param-value&gt;WEB-INF/myaspect.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;<br>
　　&lt;/context-param&gt; <br>
                      &lt;/web-app&gt;</p>
                      <p>　　all configurations can be found in jdon framework's examples.  </p>
